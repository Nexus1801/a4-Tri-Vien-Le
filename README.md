Assignment 4 - Components
===

Due: September 30th, by 11:59 AM.

For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of *either* A2 or A3 using either React or Svelte components. If you choose A3 you only need to use components for the data display / updating; you can leave your login UI as is.

[Svelte Tutorial](https://github.com/cs-4241-2024/cs-4241-2024.github.io/blob/main/using.svelte.md)  
[React Tutorial](https://github.com/cs-4241-2024/cs-4241-2024.github.io/blob/main/using.react.md)  

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them.

Deliverables

Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Implement your project with the above requirements.
3. Test your project to make sure that when someone goes to your main page on Glitch/Heroku/etc., it displays correctly.
4. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme `a4-firstname-lastname` so we can find it.
5. Fork this repository and modify the README to the specifications below. Be sure to add *all* project files.
6. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo. Name the pull request using the following template: `a4-firstname-lastname`.

Sample Readme (delete the above when you're ready to submit, and modify the below so with your links and descriptions)

## Restaurant Service (Quick-Bites from A2 assignment)

This project is derived from my A2 assignment, which is an early iteration of QuickBites. The technology used in this assignment was React, Vite, and Express. I used the same functionalities that was in A3 and implemented in the A2 version of Quick-Bites. However, I had to reorganize the client-side of the application to use the React Framework.
I personally think that the React Framework improved the readability and organization of different components which made up the entirety of the front-end of the application. Not only that, the separation of files for different components allowed me to debug each individual function rather than looking at an entire block of code.
Overall, my development experience with this assignment was good, but there were hills when it came to translating the client-side of the application from HTML to React.

- I was using ViteExpress to connect to the server at first, but had to resort to using export.static to connect to the server from 'dist'. Both the repository and glitch deployment reflect that change.
